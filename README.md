# PHP in WordPress
PHP sample codes that I tested and used:

# Telagram 
This class was created to send text to your channel in Telegram.
This is a simple and functional code to connect to Telegram api to send text.
Before using it, you need to create a bot in Telegram and get a token from it
Read this document: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendmessage
 / After that, just call:
 sendMessageToChanel($text);
 and pass your text as a string.
